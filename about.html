			<p>Hi everyone! I'm Ronin and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of
				British Columbia studying computer science! Super excited to be a software
				engineer intern this summer. One of my hobbies is filmmaking! Fun fact about
				me is that I'm Canadian.</p>
			<p>I am looking forward to finally getting to learn the barebones html, css,
				and javascript in this project!ðŸ˜ˆ</p>
