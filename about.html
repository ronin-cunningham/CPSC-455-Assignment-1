		<p>Hi everyone! I'm Ronin and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of
			British Columbia studying computer science! Super excited to be a software
			engineer intern this summer. One of my hobbies is filmmaking! Fun fact about
			me is that I'm Canadian.</p>
		<p>I am looking forward to finally getting to learn the barebones html, css,
			and javascript in this project!😈</p>
