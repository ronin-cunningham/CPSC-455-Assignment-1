				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img class="about-pic" src="resources/headshot.jpeg" />
				<p>Hi there! I'm Ronin and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of
					British Columbia studying computer science! This summer (2022) I will be a software
					engineer intern at Redfin. One of my hobbies is filmmaking! Fun fact about
					me is that I'm Canadian.</p>
				<p>Feel free to reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronincunningham/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> :)</p>

				<h2>About the Project</h2>
				<p>This website was created for the University of British Columbia's Computer Science 455 class.
					I am looking forward to finally getting to learn how to make a website with just the barebones html, css,
					and javascript in this project!ðŸ˜ˆ</p>
